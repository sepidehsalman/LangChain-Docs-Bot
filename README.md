# 🧠 Chatbot Project (FAISS + Gemini)

This project is a simple command-line chatbot that answers questions using an AI model (Google Gemini) and a set of documents stored in a **FAISS** vector index.  
All `.txt` files placed in the `knowledge_base/` folder are automatically processed and used as the chatbot’s knowledge base.

---

## Project Scope

This project implements a local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that:
✔️ Uses a FAISS vector index for retrieval
✔️ Supports plain `.txt` knowledge bases
✔️ Runs as a command-line interface

This project does _not_ include:
❌ Web UI
❌ User authentication
❌ Advanced safety filters beyond prompt constraints

---

## Guardrails & Responsible Use

To reduce risk of unsafe or hallucinated outputs:

- We use strict system prompts to limit the LLM to context from indexed documents only.
- User queries are checked for emptiness before processing.
- Files loaded into FAISS are filtered to `.txt` formats only.

⚠️ Limitations

- The system does not verify correctness of responses beyond retrieved context.
- It should not be used for critical advice (e.g., medical, legal).

## 📌 Features

- Loads multiple `.txt` files as knowledge sources
- Embeds all documents using **Gemini Embeddings**
- Stores vectors in a **FAISS index**
- Uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- Simple **CLI interface** for interactive chatting
- Custom system prompt to control chatbot behavior

---

## Sample Interaction

- Ask a question about the documents: What is X?
- Answer: X is defined as…

---

## Retrieval Evaluation

To evaluate retrieval quality, the system logs the Top-K retrieved document chunks
along with their similarity scores for each query. This allows manual inspection
of relevance and helps identify cases where insufficient or noisy context is retrieved.
If no chunk meets a minimum relevance threshold, the system safely refuses to answer
instead of hallucinating.
