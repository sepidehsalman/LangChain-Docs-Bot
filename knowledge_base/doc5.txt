Subgraphs
This guide explains the mechanics of using subgraphs. A subgraph is a graph that is used as a node in another graph.
Subgraphs are useful for:
Building multi-agent systems
Re-using a set of nodes in multiple graphs
Distributing development: when you want different teams to work on different parts of the graph independently, you can define each part as a subgraph, and as long as the subgraph interface (the input and output schemas) is respected, the parent graph can be built without knowing any details of the subgraph
When adding subgraphs, you need to define how the parent graph and the subgraph communicate:
Invoke a graph from a node — subgraphs are called from inside a node in the parent graph
Add a graph as a node — a subgraph is added directly as a node in the parent and shares state keys with the parent
