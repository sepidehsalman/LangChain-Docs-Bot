LangGraph overview
Trusted by companies shaping the future of agents— including Klarna, Replit, Elastic, and more— LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework and runtime for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents.
LangGraph is very low-level, and focused entirely on agent orchestration. Before using LangGraph, we recommend you familiarize yourself with some of the components used to build agents, starting with models and tools.
We will commonly use LangChain components throughout the documentation to integrate models and tools, but you don’t need to use LangChain to use LangGraph. If you are just getting started with agents or want a higher-level abstraction, we recommend you use LangChain’s agents that provide pre-built architectures for common LLM and tool-calling loops.
LangGraph is focused on the underlying capabilities important for agent orchestration: durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, and more.
